## ft_containers

### Description âœ¨
Ft_containers is a 42 project, written in C++, which consisted in recoding some C++ containers and all the methods (c++98).
- `Map`
- `List`
- `Stack`
- `Vector`
- `Queue`

and some others classes that I needed as `Enable_if`, `Iterator`, `ReverseIterator` (**const**)
There is a main file for each containers with all methods tested.


### Main purpose :page_facing_up:
The main objective is to understand how a container works by understanding it in depth.
Develop skills in C++ and data structures, some optimization and allocation tricks.
Use STL containers having a deep understanding of them.

### How to use :rocket:
First edit `main.cpp` and _comment/uncomment_ the main you want to test, example if you want to check the `vector` container:

```cpp
#include "main.hpp"

int main(void)
{
    //main_list();
    //main_stack();
    //main_queue();
    main_vector();
    //main_map();
    return 0;
}
```
Then run the command ``make``, and finally run:
```
./ft_containers
```
Check the output of each method tested!
